# Sprite Notes

## Sprites in Pygame
A ***class*** that combines a surface, a rect, and many additional features like animations or sound

## Drawing in Pygame
Display surface object is the only thing displayed 

Additional surfaces can be added, but they need to be attached to the display surface

## Drawing in Pygame
Surfaces cannot be moved! 

You need to put a 'rect' around them first, and that 'rect' can be moved 

## Sprite class
The sprite class makes life a lot easier and combines a surface and a rect 

But can contain more(sounds, animations, behavior etc)

You can target multiple sprites via groups
